# Dependency Injection in Kotlin 

Dependency Injection in build upon the concept of Inversion of Control. Which says that a class should get its dependencies from outside.In simple words, no class should instantiate another class but should get the instances from a configuration class.

The most important advantage is that it increases the possibility of reusing the class and to be able to test them independent of other classes.

# Mode of injections & Order
